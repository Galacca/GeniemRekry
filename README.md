# Geniem backend recruit task

This is my take on the recruit task https://github.com/devgeniem/backend-recruit-task

# Goals

All the goals and extra goals have been met.

App has been deployed to https://mh-geniem-rekry.herokuapp.com/

# Note

POST to /login/ with any of the following usernames to receive the access token:
pentti, milla, kaija.
All passwords are 123.

You can also create a new account by posting to /login/create/

The heroku app might be sluggish with response times well over 200 ms.

# Contact Info for Geniem Employers

Contact info can be found in the package.json file. I also sent a work application thru your website.
